A Trip to Plutopia

BY EMANUEL HALDEMAN-JULIUS.


Plutopia is Greek for Hog Island. It is still in the experimental
stage. The dream back of this venture is to try out the latest ideas in
exploitation, and if successful the plan is to be applied generally.

Plutopia is the heaven of the exploiters, the haven of the twelve
percenters, the paradise of the dividendists. It is a small body of
land completely surrounded by graft.

The system of government is simplicity epitomized--in fact, there is no
government. It is sublimated anarchy. The administration of affairs at
Plutopia approximating perfection, there is no need for an organized
government.

At present, there are 50,000 inhabitants at Plutopia. All but 500 are
working people.

Let me begin with the 49,500. When one describes the first he has
practically described the last, for they are about alike in dress,
habits and tastes. They do not have names; each has his own number and
answers to it like a convict.

I had occasion to interview No. 31497. He told me he was satisfied with
the way things were run and hoped there would never be a change. He
was very thankful to the 500 in the palaces, because they gave him an
opportunity to work twelve hours each day in one of the rolling mills.
He said the first thing he learned was to believe that the 49,500 who
worked should do nothing but work, while the remaining 500 who worked
not should do everything but work. He confessed this was a difficult
theory to get into his head, but as his head had never been overtaxed
in any way he managed to adopt the idea.

       *       *       *       *       *

“At present,” he said, “it seems that I always believed that we were
supposed to work all the time. The plan is easy to understand. We have
absolutely no worries, and we are taken care of as well as we’ve been
taught to expect.”

This point needed explanation, which 31497 was glad to supply. An
inventor in the employ of the 500 Plutopists had produced a pill,
which was placed on the tongue and permitted to dissolve. Three pills
went to a worker each day. It was considered sufficient to keep him
strong enough to work twelve hours each day. As for clothes, wood pulp
was used for the manufacture of paper sacks, on the back of which was
printed the number of the worker.

One huge building housed the 49,500, each being assigned to his room
which measured six by eight feet. The lights were turned off at 8:50.
Once a year, on Christmas Eve, all were given free tickets to a movie.
It was figured out scientifically that the upkeep of each hand was
exactly 11 cents and four mills a day.

No. 31497 said one good feature about the new system at Plutopia was
that the men did not have to take care of their families. In fact,
they were not permitted to have families. The women were housed in a
separate building. The children were sent to a sort of an orphanage
where they were educated to take their place in the industrial order
when they become of age, which was placed at nine years.

       *       *       *       *       *

This is highly interesting. Let us now turn our gaze towards the
remaining 500.

Where the 49,500 were housed in one building, there was a palace for
each of the beneficiaries of Plutopia. Having solved the problem of
labor, and having cut down expenses to the lowest possible point, the
income was enormous. They no longer figured in dollars and cents.
They struck off currency that began at $100,000, because they never
cared to bother with less, as it was considered very discommoding to
be cluttered up with a lot of loose change. While they believed it
was ideal for the workers to partake of food-pills three times each
day, they preferred to satisfy their gastronomical desires with more
tangible edibles. They imported chefs who were, in reality, Arabian
magicians who waved a wand and brought rare dishes from their culinary
alchemy.

There is, as we have already mentioned, no government in Plutopia.
The 500 have things arranged so precisely that there is no need for
a police force. By training the 49,500 with the utmost care there is
no need to waste money on policemen, constables and the like. As for
courts, they also were abolished, as they are considered unnecessary
expenses. In the old days, the capitalists spent huge sums in their
courts, but the science of controlling labor through psychology enabled
them to discard the expensive system, at least in this experiment
station at Plutopia.

       *       *       *       *       *

One of the most distinguished looking of the 500, when interviewed, was
quite ready to talk.

“Here is the ideal system at last,” said the Plutopist, unable to
conceal his satisfaction. “I’m sure that it will be only a question of
time before the world will follow our methods. This is the last word in
organization. We have absolutely no doubts about our hands. They are
nothing more than hands, because we are careful that nothing should
get into their craniums except what we want lodged there. There is the
secret of success. Our hands are not permitted to study, once they
are given a place in our mills, because study after working hours is
tiring and throws our whole schedule out of whack. You see, we have
just so many calories in the three pills the hand gets each day, and
if he wastes any effort we might be forced to give him four, and that
would increase expenses one-third of a cent, which we could never
consider.

“Besides, thinking is bad for contentment. We don’t like them to think
about anything but their work. If there is any thinking to be done
around here, we take the job on our own shoulders.”

“What must be done before a person can become one of the 500?” the
Plutopist was asked.

“Nothing. We have a closed corporation and we try to pass the property
on only to our blood relatives. Sometimes we reach out and invite
outsiders. But the best method is that of inheritance. We got it from
our parents, and our children will get it from us. It’s much like
being a crown prince.”

“How about the 49,500? Do they stand a chance to join your 500?”

“Of course they do. They have a wonderful chance. If we happen to like
one, we could have him admitted to our ranks by voting on the question.
A unanimous vote is needed, however. But that doesn’t alter the fact
that our hands have an equal chance to take our places.”

“Have you ever admitted one of your hands?”

“No, not yet. We may some day.”

“Aren’t you a little afraid that this army of hands might get organized
and throw your friends into the discard?”

“Ah, you mean: Are we afraid of Socialism? Not a whit. Our hands are
too well trained. You already understand how we take them through
our training school and turn them out perfect workers. That is our
strongest argument. Our scientists are now at work on a still bigger
idea. This is confidential, of course.”

“Certainly,” I answered. “Not a word will be said about it.”

“Very well,” he answered. “See that it goes no further. We are working
on a wonderful idea. We see the possibility of doing away entirely with
our expensive training school!”

This was interesting. Urged to continue, he added:

“If nature is able to give us human beings with hands, eyes, ears and
finger nails, why not have nature go still further and present us with
human beings who already have the ideas we try so hard to inculcate?”

This was too brilliant for syntax. They had hit on the amazing idea of
breeding ideal hands. It was almost unbelievable.

“We’ll work it out in time. Our hope is to combine the strength of
the ox with the blind loyalty of the dog, the self-sacrifice of the
egg-laying hen and the mentality of the jackass. It’s revolutionary,
but it can be done. When we succeed, our problem will be solved for all
time.”

       *       *       *       *       *

The interview at an end, I applied for a pass to the training school.
Being a friendly sort of person and knowing there could be no harm in
granting the request, the Plutopist wrote out the order.

I began my tour in the kindergarten. There I saw a large class of
children, all under five years of age. They were being taught how to
use words. In unison they recited: “I want to work!”

“Very good,” said the teacher. “Very good. Now try to put a little
more gladness into your voices.”

With added enthusiasm, the children yelled: “I want to work!”

It was inspiring.

Next came:

“Twelve hours a day! I want to work! Twelve hours a day!”

The teacher announced, a little later, that the children must say this
100 times each day, including Sunday. In the next class, the children
are given little jobs. The mills were reproduced in miniature and the
children were impressed with the fact that the greatest happiness would
come when they became old enough to go into the genuine mills. In the
miniature the youngsters tended machines that were as tiny as dolls and
yet able to do satisfactory work. Incidentally, these children, despite
the smallness of the tools, turned out quite an amount of goods, but,
unfortunately, the output was not enough to cover expenses. This
was the fatal flaw in the system and undoubtedly was the reason why
the 500 wanted to do away with it entirely and resort to having the
children born with the idea of the virtue of work and the blessedness
of producing for others.

As stated before, when the child becomes nine years old, a place is
found in the mills. Up to then, the total cost of upkeep for each child
is four and six-tenths of a cent per day.

       *       *       *       *       *

I heard a great commotion. The teachers were rushing about in terror.
Something fearful must have happened. I rushed along with them and when
the opportunity presented itself I asked the cause of this excitement.

“It’s too terrible for words,” answered the person to whom I had
directed my question. “It’s the first time such a thing ever happened.”

“What?” I demanded.

“The children in the kindergarten were repeating their lesson a few
minutes ago and everything was going nicely. They were saying ‘I want
to work’ as they should when one boy forgot himself and said: ‘I want a
pair of skates!’ It’s too terrible! too terrible!”

And then, trying to excuse the slip, the teacher added:

“It may be a hereditary taint. It must be.”

“What makes you think so?”

“It has been reported that this boy’s father is a dangerous character
who will bear watching. Once he made a remark to the effect that he
thought it might be a good idea if the hands got four pills a day
instead of three. Think of it! He actually proposed an increase in
rations of 200 calories, or 1,400 a week. Oh, we must watch these
hands. Even after the best kind of an education they are likely to get
socialistic ideas.”

“What will you do if they threaten to go on strike for the extra pill?”

“Oh, there are plenty of ways of handling the issue. If feeling gets
strong and it begins to look as though they stand a chance of winning,
we’ll give in to them.”

“Is it possible?”

“We will give in, but there won’t be any real difference in the end.
Let me explain. They get 600 calories a day, and as we control the
manufacture of food-pills, we will give them four a day, but there will
be 150 instead of 200 calories in each. That’s one way. But I don’t
think it will ever come to that point. We have them too well trained.”

Yes, Plutopia is a wonderful island. It will work as long as the hands
consent to work. But so long as there are youngsters who crave a pair
of skates and a grown-up who doesn’t conceal his desire for an extra
pill, there is a standing menace to the future security of Plutopia.

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
